# XSLTug

A command-line shell for orchestrating XSLT transformation pipelines.

To use:

1. Acquire Saxon (any version since 9.9)
1. Set up your environment, \*nix or Windows
1. Use the command syntax given to invoke XSLT transformations and pipelines
1. Extend the command syntax with your own mapping configurations (in XML)

## Acquire Saxon

Saxon is the industry-leading XSLT 3.0 processor.

With Java installed, you can use Saxon with a path to its `jar` file.

Or on Windows you can also run Saxon under .NET (see their docs)
