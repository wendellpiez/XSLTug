# XSLTug

A command-line shell for orchestrating XSLT transformation pipelines.

# Who is it for (XSLT developers)

If you don't need to run XSLT pipelines, you have no need for this tool.

If you do run such pipelines, using XProc, Ant or anything you have developed yourself, you probably don't need this tool, which provides similar functionality, but which is "peculiar". 

If you deploy XSLT pipelines using shell scripts such as `bash` or Windows "batch syntax", you might consider using XSLTug in whole or in part. (If you use `make`, I salute you.)

If you deploy such pipelines to be used by team as "appliances", you might be particularly interested.

# Why this approach?

## XSLT pipelines as black boxes

## Extensibility / Learnability

## Security

## Limitations

# To use:

1. Acquire Saxon (any version since 9.9)
1. Set up your environment, \*nix or Windows
1. Use the command syntax given to invoke XSLT transformations and pipelines
1. Extend the command syntax with your own mapping configurations (in XML)

### Acquire Saxon

Saxon is the industry-leading XSLT 3.0 processor.

With Java installed, you can use Saxon with a path to its `jar` file.

Or on Windows you can also run Saxon under .NET (see their docs)


### Environment

Edit the scripts to replace the developer's paths with your own.

### Command syntax
